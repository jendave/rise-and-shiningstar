> You have been called to a settlement known as Shiningstar, whether to answer a distress call, find a missing person, or strange visions beckon you. Whatever the case, upon your arrival, you discover that Shiningstar—the settlement that focused on healing and life—has taken a turn for the worse.

Ever need a quick adventure to introduce new players to [Ironsworn:Starforged](https://tomkinpress.com/)? Need something to drop into a current campaign to get things moving along?

Just wanna try out a new character and see how they play?

Well, I've got the solution for you: a quick and easy one-shot! Rise & Shiningstar was made for pretty much all the reasons above, and probably a few more I don't know about. It's built to allow as much creative freedom in the adventure as possible, while still providing a fully fleshed-out adventure that doesn't require you to plan ahead or interpret every vague oracle result. Mix and match, drag and drop, plug and play as much as you want.

In terms of XP, this adventure allows you to complete one Vow and up to two Expeditions, as well as a chance to use multiple Connection Moves. There's also plenty of room for combat, or you can avoid or ignore it entirely.

Within this game-ready adventure, you will find new foes, macros, journal entries and roll tables.
