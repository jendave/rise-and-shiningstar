d100 Pre-rolled Waypoint
### Below is a table of pre-rolled and fleshed-out Waypoints. Choose one of the numbers on your challenge dice after you Undertake an Expedition and use the corresponding Waypoint if you don't want to come up with one yourself. Or, select whichever one that interests you the most. Feel free to change any part of them or mix and match.
1-10 An operating room comes into view before you. Jars of biological specimens line the walls. Most of the jars are full, but a few have crashed onto the floor. A few of the jars appear to have been empty.
11-20 A large corridor stretches before you. The lights are flickering. Many of the doors are shut, while a few of them are bent as if something was trying to force its way in or out.
21-30 An equipment room stands out. If you had to guess, perhaps 10 by 10? Stacked alongside boxes of various labeled goods... is a mound of motionless Risen. Most are missing limbs and they seem completely inert.
31-40 A control room, but it looks barely operational. There are a few random personal objects from those who worked in the room. Poking around with the controls, you are able to see the initial Risen attack on Shiningstar.
41-50 The living quarters, though it seems to have enough room for just one person. The room is chaos, as all the belongings have been tossed about. Blood splatter is on the wall, and a trail of blood is leaving the room.
51-60 A common area. There are a few broken screens and rotten half-eaten food. Magazines and pamphlets are thrown about.
61-70 There are stairs going to another floor. On the landing, a malfunctioning bot sits in the corner, a flickering smile on its display. It greets you if you approach.
71-80 Off to one side of a communal area is an agnostic place of worship, though someone has set up the chapel for a specific deity. Behind it, a panoramic viewport, with a breathtaking view of space.
81-90 A promenade, overlooking a dying indoor forest. The plants and small trees look as if they haven’t been watered in weeks. Below, Risen roam and bodies decay.
91-100 A completely sealed room, though you can see inside through an observatory window. Inside, a few Risen and stacks of body bags. Oddly enough, within another containment unit: a vibrant, thriving tree. You can see small lifeforms, probably bugs, fluttering about within the containment unit.

d6 Quest Hooks
### How are you dragged into this? Choose one result or roll on this oracle.
1 A priceless artifact's last known location is somewhere within a settlement known as Shiningstar. Word on the street is it could go for millions, at a minimum. And you know that if you've heard of it, someone else did, too.  <em>Do you swear to retrieve the artifact?</em>
2 A connection of yours contacts you in dire need. They have been gravely injured and things are not looking good. It’s well beyond your capabilities. They mention a settlement named Shiningstar that may be able to help. They are sure that the medicine and technology needed are there. <em>Do you swear a vow to retrieve what they need?</em>
3 Out of the blue, you receive a distress signal. It’s not directly addressed to you — instead, to “anyone who can hear this.” The message is choppy at best and there are sounds of commotion and chaos in the background. The most you can make out is the person asking for help and to please hurry to the Shiningstar settlement. <em>Do you swear to help this person you don't even know?</em>
4 A connection of yours contacts you about delivering a shipment of valuable, lifesaving tech to some settlement called Shiningstar. Problem is, they can’t seem to get in contact with their person within the settlement. The materials are time-sensitive. <em>Do you swear to deliver the shipment to Shiningstar?</em>
5 Venri Taylen has a large bounty on their head. They have evaded capture all throughout the sector so far, but of course, this was before you got involved. Rumor has it that they were headed towards a settlement called Shiningstar. <em>Do you swear to bring them in?</em>
6 You are haunted by vague dreams – often nightmares – depicting a tree that gives birth to a shining star, surrounded by depictions of both life and death. In an attempt to understand these visions, you overhear murmurs of a settlement named Shiningstar. You know there is no such thing as coincidences. <em>Do you swear to uncover the meaning behind your cryptic visions?</em>

d100 Things you uncover during your initial investigation
### Roll 2-3 times on the following table to learn what you discover while getting prepared. Or perhaps you can take a number of clues based on the action die value of your previous moves. Or know them all. It's up to you!
01-16 While also focusing on expanding medical knowledge, they have grown quite a few plants and trees on board. The plantlife helps aid in breathability, as well as other benefits, for all of its inhabitants.
17-33 Shiningstar specializes in research and medicine. They work hard to add their medical knowledge and expertise to the Forge.
34-50 Shiningstar sends out established healers and trainees to various settlements and provides healing for free. They often simply ask for small donations or lodging while they do their work.
51-66 The settlement has been radio-silent. No one has gotten word into or out of Shiningstar for some time now.
67-83 While a medical and research facility first and foremost, many people live large chunks of their lives on board. Shiningstar used to be a generation ship.
84-100 It’s rumored that a few years ago Shiningstar received a large amount of money from a mysterious donor for a top-secret project.

d100 What you discover while in Shiningstar
### The Truth About Shiningstar - While navigating through Shiningstar, its ill-fated story becomes clear to you. As you mark progress on the expedition, learn a number of facts based on the number of boxes filled. You can learn them in order or randomly by rolling, or you can pick whatever seems appropriate based on the waypoint.
1-10 Ash Durant donated a large amount of money to fund Shiningstar’s research. They wanted Shiningstar to essentially make them immortal, and money was no object. Shiningstar began focusing a lot of time on this endeavor.
11-20 Shiningstar passed by a mysterious habitable planet. Dr. Hendrix was given a sample of the plant life there and began growing a large tree onboard. They believed it had medicinal properties.
21-30 Shiningstar figured out the secret to immortality thanks to Dr. Hendrix’s tree and its flowers. They kept their findings a secret from the rest of the Forge. They called it Project ALEX.
31-40 Project ALEX was tested on a few terminal patients and met with great success. Not all survived, though. A few of those who survived eventually left Shiningstar with their loved ones.
41-50 The crematorium on board was shut down temporarily due to a malfunction. A few dead bodies — some of them Project ALEX test subjects that were deemed failures — were locked away while the issue was worked on.
51-60 Shiningstar encountered its first Risen, but it was swiftly dealt with. Security was hired to watch over the settlement more closely. They also hired a researcher to investigate how a Risen was created.
61-70 Shiningstar's power was knocked out for a few hours after traveling a great distance, plunging the settlement into darkness. Risen attacked.
71-80 The Risen attacked in the dark, feeding on any and everyone they could reach. It was discovered then these Risen would almost freeze if caught within most lighting. And that they had almost plant-like qualities.
81-90 The damage to Shiningstar grew more extensive, causing the power to become less reliable. The Risen thrived.
91-100 The Shiningstar Chimera was created as a flood of survivors all tried to leave at once, only to end up trapped in one area. The Shiningstar Risen took advantage of this.

1-10  A rotten smell wafts your way. Its stench is unbearable. It causes your stomach to twist and turn.
11-20 Two survivors. They share what they know with you. However, you quickly learn that one of them is in the process of becoming a Risen... right before they attack the other, and then you.
21-30 You discover something detrimental related to another quest you’re on that negates a previously believed truth.

41-50 An ad-hoc device — which you quickly learn was supposed to be an explosive — suddenly detonates.
51-60 The gravity on the ship causes you to drop to the ceiling, then back down again. You are fine, but something on your person isn’t as lucky.
61-70 The lights turn off, and all of the Risen turn ravenous. They move about in search of other light or moisture to satiate them.
71-80 A journal with details of Project ALEX, and the following sentence: "It may have escaped. The Forge is doomed."
81-90 The paths are trickier than you anticipated. It’s going to take you a while longer to get from here to your next waypoint.
91-100 You are sure you have failed. Whatever brought you here initially is lost to you or unobtainable.
